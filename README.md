# JavaScript Fundamentals Quiz (Timed!)

## Description

This application uses vanilla Javascript to dynamically create a Timed multiple choice quiz.

With each question answered incorrectly, the timer decrements by an additional 10 seconds, and

the user will have the opportunity to submit their initials and score at the end of the Quiz.

I struggled with the entire project but mainly how to get the quizElements object array to display one question after the other

with the corresponding answer options. This was a giant hurdle for me personally, and is why I decided it was important to complete it.
