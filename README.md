# JavaScript Fundamentals Quiz (Timed!)

## Description

This project was an assignment to test my ability to code vanilla javaScript in a responsive way.

I will be continuing to work on this project when I have extra time, as I did not finish it.

As of now, my quiz application has a functioning start button, and the first question appears.

There is also a timer countdown that functions at this time that is displayed when the user clicks "start".
